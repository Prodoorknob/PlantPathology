# PlantPathology
Computer Vision model using TensorFlow Deep learning Neural networks to predict plant diseases. 
Developed deep learning image classification model to classify disease category in leaf and identify disease from multiple symptoms on single image. 
Utilized transfer learning via pre-trained CNN models including Resnet50 and Xception to boost accuracy.
